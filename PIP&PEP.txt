ðŸ”¹ PIP (Pip Installs Packages)
What it is:
PIP is the default package manager for Python. It allows you to install, update, and manage external libraries (packages) that are not part of the Python standard library.

Purpose:
To make it easy to download and install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) â€” the central repository of Python libraries.

Example usage in command line:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy         # Install a package
pip uninstall pandas      # Uninstall a package
pip list                  # List installed packages
pip install requests==2.25.0  # Install a specific version
Why it's important:
PIP helps Python developers extend Python's functionality by using pre-built libraries instead of writing everything from scratch.

ðŸ”¹ PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal)
What it is:
PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a design document that provides information to the Python community or proposes new features, improvements, or processes for Python.

Purpose:
To standardize and improve Python by documenting ideas, designs, and guidelines in a formal and structured way.

Famous PEPs:

PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code (how to write readable code)

PEP 20 â€“ The Zen of Python (philosophy of Python)

PEP 484 â€“ Type Hints (introducing type annotations)

PEP 572 â€“ Assignment Expressions (:= operator)

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
# PEP 8 suggests using lowercase_with_underscores for function names
def calculate_area(radius):
    return 3.14 * radius ** 2
Why it's important:
PEPs ensure transparency and consistency in Python's evolution and help everyone follow the same coding and development standards.

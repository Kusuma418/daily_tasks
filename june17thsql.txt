SET 1

1: Find Employees Earning More Than Their Department’s Average Salary
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.salary, e.dept_id
FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY dept_id
) d_avg ON e.dept_id = d_avg.dept_id
WHERE e.salary > d_avg.avg_salary;


2: Find Employees Who Worked on All Projects in Their Department
   First, we need to assume that a project belongs to the department of the employee who worked on it (since the projects table doesn't directly link to departments).
Step-by-step logic:
For each department, find all project IDs.
For each employee, count how many of their department's projects they’ve worked on.
If this count matches the total number of department projects → include.

WITH dept_projects AS (
    SELECT d.dept_id, p.project_id
    FROM projects p
    JOIN employees e ON p.emp_id = e.emp_id
    JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
),
emp_dept_projects AS (
    SELECT e.emp_id, e.dept_id, p.project_id
    FROM employees e
    JOIN projects p ON e.emp_id = p.emp_id
),
project_counts AS (
    SELECT dept_id, COUNT(DISTINCT project_id) AS total_projects
    FROM dept_projects
    GROUP BY dept_id
),
emp_project_counts AS (
    SELECT emp_id, dept_id, COUNT(DISTINCT project_id) AS emp_projects
    FROM emp_dept_projects
    GROUP BY emp_id, dept_id
)
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name
FROM emp_project_counts ep
JOIN project_counts pc ON ep.dept_id = pc.dept_id
JOIN employees e ON e.emp_id = ep.emp_id
WHERE ep.emp_projects = pc.total_projects;



3: Find the Highest-Paid Employee in Each Department Who Started After 2020
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, dept_id, salary, hire_date
FROM employees e1
WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'
AND salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.dept_id = e1.dept_id AND e2.hire_date > '2020-01-01'
);



4: Find Departments Where All Employees Earn Above a Certain Threshold (e.g., 55000)
SELECT d.dept_id, d.dept_name
FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employees e
    WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id AND e.salary <= 55000
);



SET 2
1: Find Regions Where No Customer Ordered a Specific Product (e.g., product_id = 202)
SELECT DISTINCT c.region
FROM customers c
WHERE c.customer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o.customer_id
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
    WHERE od.product_id = 202
);
